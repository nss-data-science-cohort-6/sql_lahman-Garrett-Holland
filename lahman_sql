-- 1. Find all players in the database who played at Vanderbilt University. Create a list showing each player's first and last names as well as the total salary they earned in the major leagues. Sort this list in descending order by the total salary earned. Which Vanderbilt player earned the most money in the majors?
SELECT people.namefirst, people.namelast, sum(salaries.salary) / count(DISTINCT collegeplaying.yearid) as total_salary
FROM collegeplaying
JOIN schools ON collegeplaying.schoolid = schools.schoolid
JOIN people ON collegeplaying.playerid = people.playerid
JOIN salaries ON collegeplaying.playerid = salaries.playerid
WHERE schools.schoolname = 'Vanderbilt University'
GROUP BY people.playerid
ORDER BY total_salary DESC;

-- 2. Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position: label players with position OF as "Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery". Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.
WITH positions AS (
  SELECT playerid, pos, sum(po) AS putouts
  FROM fielding
  WHERE yearid = 2016
  GROUP BY playerid, pos
), groups AS (
  SELECT playerid, 
    CASE 
      WHEN pos IN ('OF') THEN 'Outfield'
      WHEN pos IN ('SS', '1B', '2B', '3B') THEN 'Infield'
      WHEN pos IN ('P', 'C') THEN 'Battery'
    END AS group_name,
    putouts
  FROM positions
)
SELECT group_name, sum(putouts) as total_putouts
FROM groups
GROUP BY group_name;

-- 3. Find the average number of strikeouts per game by decade since 1920. Round the numbers you report to 2 decimal places. Do the same for home runs per game. Do you see any trends?
SELECT FLOOR(yearid / 10) * 10 AS decade,
       ROUND(AVG(so) / AVG(g), 2) AS avg_so_per_game,
       ROUND(AVG(hr) / AVG(g), 2) AS avg_hr_per_game
FROM teams
WHERE yearid >= 1920
GROUP BY decade
ORDER BY decade DESC;
-- Strikeouts are rising at a much more drastic rate than Home Runs.

-- 4. Find the player who had the most success stealing bases in 2016, where success is measured as the percentage of stolen base attempts which are successful. (A stolen base attempt results either in a stolen base or being caught stealing.) Consider only players who attempted at least 20 stolen bases. Report the players' names, number of stolen bases, number of attempts, and stolen base percentage.
SELECT 
  people.namefirst, 
  people.namelast, 
  100.0 * SUM(batting.sb) / (SUM(batting.sb) + SUM(batting.cs)) AS stolen_base_percentage
FROM people 
JOIN batting ON people.playerid = batting.playerid
WHERE batting.yearid = 2016 
  AND batting.sb >= 20 
GROUP BY people.playerid 
ORDER BY stolen_base_percentage DESC 
LIMIT 1;

-- 5. From 1970 to 2016, what is the largest number of wins for a team that did not win the world series? What is the smallest number of wins for a team that did win the world series? Doing this will probably result in an unusually small number of wins for a world series champion; determine why this is the case. Then redo your query, excluding the problem year. How often from 1970 to 2016 was it the case that a team with the most wins also won the world series? What percentage of the time?
SELECT teams.yearid, teamsfranchises.franchname, teams.w as most_wins
FROM teams
JOIN teamsfranchises ON teams.franchid = teamsfranchises.franchid
WHERE teams.yearid BETWEEN 1970 AND 2016 AND teams.wswin = 'N'
AND teams.w = (SELECT max(w) FROM teams WHERE yearid = teams.yearid AND wswin = 'N')
ORDER BY teams.yearid;

-- 6. Which managers have won the TSN Manager of the Year award in both the National League (NL) and the American League (AL)? Give their full name and the teams that they were managing when they won the award.
SELECT DISTINCT people.namefirst, people.namelast,
MIN(CASE WHEN awardsmanagers.lgid = 'NL' THEN awardsmanagers.awardid END) AS team_NL,
MIN(CASE WHEN awardsmanagers.lgid = 'AL' THEN awardsmanagers.awardid END) AS team_AL
FROM people
JOIN awardsmanagers ON awardsmanagers.playerid = people.playerid
WHERE awardsmanagers.awardid = 'TSN Manager of the Year'
GROUP BY people.namefirst, people.namelast
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT awardsmanagers.lgid) = 2;

-- 7. Which pitcher was the least efficient in 2016 in terms of salary / strikeouts? Only consider pitchers who started at least 10 games (across all teams). Note that pitchers often play for more than one team in a season, so be sure that you are counting all stats for each player.
SELECT people.namefirst, people.namelast,
SUM(salaries.salary) / SUM(pitching.so) AS salary_per_strikeout
FROM pitching
JOIN people ON pitching.playerid = people.playerid
JOIN salaries ON pitching.playerid = salaries.playerid AND pitching.yearid = salaries.yearid
WHERE pitching.yearid = 2016 AND pitching.g >= 10
GROUP BY people.playerid, people.namefirst, people.namelast
ORDER BY salary_per_strikeout
LIMIT 1;

-- 8. Find all players who have had at least 3000 career hits. Report those players' names, total number of hits, and the year they were inducted into the hall of fame (If they were not inducted into the hall of fame, put a null in that column.) Note that a player being inducted into the hall of fame is indicated by a 'Y' in the inducted column of the halloffame table.
SELECT people.namefirst, people.namelast, SUM(batting.h) AS total_hits, halloffame.yearid
FROM batting
JOIN people ON batting.playerid = people.playerid
LEFT JOIN halloffame ON batting.playerid = halloffame.playerid AND halloffame.inducted = 'Y'
GROUP BY people.playerid, people.namefirst, people.namelast, halloffame.yearid
HAVING SUM(batting.h) >= 3000
ORDER BY total_hits DESC;

-- 9. Find all players who had at least 1,000 hits for two different teams. Report those players' full names.
SELECT people.namefirst, people.namelast
FROM (
SELECT playerid, SUM(h) AS total_hits
FROM batting
GROUP BY playerid, teamid
HAVING SUM(h) >= 1000
) AS player_stats
JOIN people ON people.playerid = player_stats.playerid
GROUP BY people.playerid, people.namefirst, people.namelast
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;

-- 10. Find all players who hit their career highest number of home runs in 2016. Consider only players who have played in the league for at least 10 years, and who hit at least one home run in 2016. Report the players' first and last names and the number of home runs they hit in 2016.
WITH player_stats AS (
SELECT batting.playerid, namefirst, namelast, SUM(CASE WHEN yearid = 2016 THEN hr ELSE 0 END) AS home_runs_2016, COUNT(DISTINCT yearid) AS years_played
FROM batting
JOIN people ON batting.playerid = people.playerid
GROUP BY batting.playerid, namefirst, namelast
)
SELECT namefirst, namelast, home_runs_2016
FROM player_stats
WHERE years_played >= 10 AND home_runs_2016 > 0 
ORDER BY home_runs_2016 DESC;
